# master-thesis
In this repository you will find the experiment, all scripts and all the raw data from my master thesis which is supervised by [@LuSchumacher](https://github.com/LuSchumacher) and[@mschnuerch](https://github.com/mschnuerch)
If you want to run this code on your machine, keep in mind that your c++ toolchain needs to be configured so that RStan can be used. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

For the experiment to run you will need Opensesame which can be found [here](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.3/).

At the moment the code needs some adaptions to be able to reproduce all analysis and graphs after being downloaded, mainly concerning file locations.
